# Tech Repair Notes App Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of the Tech Repair Notes App! This backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, with MongoDB as the database and Mongoose for object modeling. JWT is implemented for authentication, CORS for handling cross-origin requests, and dotenv for environment variables configuration.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Secure user authentication with JWT tokens.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on users and notes.
- **Role-based Access Control**: Define different access levels for employees (Employee, Manager, Admin).
- **MongoDB Integration**: Store and manage data in MongoDB, ensuring scalability and reliability.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling mechanisms for improved reliability.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, providing robust features for building APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing and managing application data.
- **Mongoose**: Elegant MongoDB object modeling for Node.js.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for secure authentication.
- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware for handling CORS.
- **dotenv**: Environment variables management for configuration.

## Getting Started

To set up the backend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure environment variables in a `.env` file (e.g., database connection string, JWT secret).
4. Start the server using `npm start`.

## API Documentation

Detailed API documentation is provided within the codebase. Refer to the relevant API routes and controllers for usage details.

## Deployment
